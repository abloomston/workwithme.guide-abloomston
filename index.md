## Values and Personality

* I aspire to be **self-reflexive**, to have and model **humility**.
* I place a high value on **self-accountability** and **follow-through**.
* Facilitating the **growth** of other technologists is very important to me.

*Please provide [feedback](#receiving-feedback--recognition) if and when you feel I could do better in holding these values.*

## Me Being Me

* I'm very **confident**, often to a fault. *Sometimes I sound more confident than I am or feel. Feel free to probe if you perceive me as being overly confident‚ÄîI'm working on this.*
* I can be quite **frank**, especially when I'm lost in the idea being discussed.
* I come from a very large, vocal family‚ÄîI can sometimes worry about feeling **heard**.
* I've been known to be **verbose**, e.g. this document.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

* I prefer when others **ask permission** before giving feedback. This helps me to prepare for potential criticism, and gives me the choice to defer it if I'm not in a good place to receive it.
* I prefer to receive criticism **in private** and with **concrete examples** of where I could have done better‚Äîthese help anchor me in the facts, rather than my emotions. *I appreciate and value this feedback, and can‚Äôt get enough of it.*
* I **appreciate recognition** for my positive impact.

## Areas for Development

Here are the areas I'm focused on growing in 2018:

* Facilitating technical growth
* Leadership
  * I attended a [Co-Active Leadership Experience](http://www.coactive.com/leadership/experience) Workshop in 2018
  * I will be participating in an upcoming [Co-Active Leadership Program](http://www.coactive.com/leadership/program)
* Facilitation
  * I attended a [Group Facilitation Skills](http://www.communityatwork.com/groupfac1.html) Workshop in 2018
* The intersection of Leadership, Systems Thinking, Software Development, and Organizations: everything written by [Gerald Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Weinberg)

*[Feedback](#receiving-feedback--recognition) is always appreciated, especially in the areas above.*

## Work Patterns

* I work as an engineer on the Anti-discrimination team at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.io/).
* In the mornings (10am-12pm) I tend to focus on solo (üéß) work away from my desk (usually 888 2F in Santorini‚Äîit reminds me of [Chefchaouen](https://www.vogue.com/article/chefchaouen-morocco-blue-city)).
* After lunch (1pm-6pm) if not in meetings I'm usually at my desk (888 4F near Waterman); **I prefer meetings, including 1:1s, after lunch**.
* I follow and work from home on [No Meeting Wednesdays](https://wavelength.asana.com/workstyle-no-meeting-wednesdays/#close).

## Communication Preferences

I aim to **respond to emails the same business day**. I check Slack and aim to **respond in Slack within an hour**.

I take **distraction** seriously and am very sensitive to **work-life-balance;** for example phones are left by the door, on vibrate (exception is if I'm on-call), in my home.

## How To Know I‚Äôve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

* I'm quick to judge or make large generalizations such as "I hate postgres."
* I focus on minor points of logical error, losing the forest for the trees in a discussion.
* I mention that I'm "hangry" (hungry + angry)‚Äîthis means I haven't eaten in a few hours.

### How to help

* Ask me if it would be helpful to table the conversation until later.
* Ask me what my goal is in the conversation.
* Offer me food, such as a üçå

## Pet Peeves

*I don't expect this list to change your actions‚Äîbut it might help you better understand and empathize with my reactions.*

* Tardiness‚Äî*I'm a New Yorker, after all.*
* Meetings without a clear agenda or an explicit facilitator.
* A (perceived) lack of follow-through.

## Acronyms I Use
* **(FY)SA**‚Äî (for your) situational awareness: something I think you might need to be aware of, depending on what you're working on. This may also be something I did that doesn't have a high level of public visibility or record associated with it, such as a production configuration change that isn't in some audit-able log. [Some](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sarapackman) have asked excellent questions about FYSA vs FYI‚Äîthis may be prompting a small crisis of identity while I work this out for myself.

## Ask Me About

1. Why I love to travel ([hint](http://mrconsole-eats.tumblr.com/)).
2. My uninformed obsession with birds.
