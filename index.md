# Here are the four qualities I value most in collaboration:

## 1. Craft

_I treat work as a craft—continuously cultivating key skills and bringing in intellectual frameworks so that we can do our best work as individuals and as a team._

_What this means to me_: As part of this value, I place a high value on self-accountability and follow-through. 

_How this shows up in my work_:

Crafts I’m currently cultivating are:

* Facilitating technical growth
* Facilitative leadership
* Group facilitation with a focus on a graphical style

Areas in which I’m intellectually focused right now include:

* Systems thinking
* Long term project planning
* Privacy, ethics, and machine learning

I draw inspiration from the craft of these people:

* [Dr. Latanya Sweeney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latanya_Sweeney)
* [Bhikkhu Bodhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu_Bodhi)
* [Dr. Diane Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Vaughan)
* [Alberta Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Hunter)
* [Dr. Gerald Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Weinberg)

_Invitation_: Check out the trainings and conferences I am attending on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-bloomston/).

## 2. Inclusion

_A diversity of voices participating in the dialogue is essential for solving complex systemic issues. Plus, it’s just the right thing to do._

_What this means to me_: I cultivate and protect the psychological safety of the team above all—in general and in meetings. As a facilitator, I will also look for ways to engage and balance the voices in the room and create trust.

_How this shows up in my work_: I believe in meeting agendas and target outcomes as a core principle of inclusion. If we all know what we agree to, then we start from an even foundation. I always ask for an agenda before accepting meeting invites.

_Invitation_: Use and share [these principles of inclusion in meetings](#principles-for-inclusive-meetings).

## 3. Growth

_I view every working relationship as an avenue for mutual growth for its own sake and for the sake of extraordinary project outcomes on behalf of the humans we create for._

_What this means to me_: I foster a team environment that supports feedback and constructive dialogue whatever role I have on that team. Whether I am on a project that is big or small or weighing in as a stakeholder, I engage whole-heartedly. I am known for facilitating discussions about the team’s current areas for development and setting a tone for vulnerability and mutual accountability. I believe in setting the tone for saying the things that often go unsaid, and giving precise and candid feedback.

_How this shows up in my work_: In my personal growth, I am leaning into curiosity as my go-to reaction to pretty much everything. I’m also looking to add to the modalities with which I express my contribution, thus I’m learning graphical facilitation.

_Invitation_:

* If we are going to start collaborating, I invite you to setup an hour with me and I’ll help you draft your own [Work With Me Guide](http://workwithme.guide/).
* Please give me feedback.
* Use and share these tips on [how to give feedback](#tips-for-giving-feedback) and [how to navigate rough terrain in personal dialogue](#tips-for-navigating-rough-terrain-in-interpersonal-dialogue).
* Airbnb colleagues: You can submit feedback (compliments, suggestions, criticisms, and advice) to my manager at [air/feedback-for-adam-bloomston](https://air/feedback-for-adam-bloomston). Reflektive is a great place for appreciation/recognition.
* I’m energized by growth relationships of mutual exchange outside of project work (rather than the standard mentor-mentee dynamic). Please feel free to approach me if you have an idea.

## 4. Focus

_I am committed to presence in my worklife._

_What this means to me_: If I’m with you, I’m present. When I’m focused on solo work most mornings and Wednesdays, I protect that flow.

_How this shows up in my work_: You can rely on my calendar and Slack status as very up-to-date. When I’m not working, my phone is usually not near me, on vibrate (unless I’m on call).

_Invitation_: Speaking of time outside of work, ask me about my uninformed obsession with birds or my dog, Baby Doctor, whom I bring to work with me every day. If he’s bothering you at all, please let me know—no offense will be taken, I promise!

## Here are resources for teams and fellow human beings

### Principles for Inclusive Meetings

* Agree upon agenda and outcomes before diving into content.
* Be curious and ask questions.
* Be aware and responsible if you are taking up more than a fair share of the air space. If you're often the first to speak, count to 5 slowly first.
* If you're unsure how knowledgeable someone is about a topic, ask "How familiar are you with X?" rather than "Do you know about X?"

### Tips for Giving Feedback

* Ask permission before giving feedback.
* Give criticism in private and with concrete examples to help people anchor in the facts, rather than emotions.
* Appreciate and give recognition for positive impact. Two related concepts to consider: [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) and [positive deviance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_deviance).
* Champion an attribution culture.

### Tips for Navigating Rough Terrain in Interpersonal Dialogue

* Articulate your intention to reground the conversation and as an invitation to get on the same page again.
* Focus on hearing over correcting, listening over speaking.
* Offer food.
